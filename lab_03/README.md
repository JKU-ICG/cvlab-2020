# Structure

 * `*.m`: Matlab scripts.
 * `util/`: utility Matlab scripts. Little helpers for working with the data.
 * `data/`: contains data (e.g., images and .mat files) used in the scripts. Note that additional data needs to be downloaded.
    * [data_SAR.zip(JKUDrive)](https://drive.jku.at/filr/public-link/file-download/ff8080827595a35701759e6ca83d481f/22192/-5528057403698270347/data_SAR.zip)
